User Requesting Website:

A user wants to access the website by typing "www.foobar.com" into their web browser.
Specifics about the Infrastructure:

Server: The physical or virtual machine that hosts all components of the website.

Domain Name (foobar.com): A human-readable address that allows users to access the website. It's configured to point to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8) using a DNS record.

DNS Record (www): The DNS record type used for "www.foobar.com" is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. It aliases the "www" subdomain to the main domain name (foobar.com).

Web Server (Nginx): Nginx handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and serves appropriate content. It can serve static content or forward dynamic requests to the application server.

Application Server: This server executes application code to generate dynamic content. It processes user inputs, interacts with databases, and generates web pages on-the-fly.

Database (MySQL): It stores and manages data used by the application. It provides a structured way to organize, retrieve, and update information.

Communication with User's Computer: The server communicates with the user's computer over the HTTP protocol. This defines how data is formatted and transmitted between the client (user's computer) and the server.

Issues with this Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): This infrastructure has a single server, which means if it fails, the entire website will become inaccessible. To address this, redundancy or failover solutions could be implemented.

Downtime for Maintenance: When maintenance is needed, such as deploying new code or restarting the web server, the website may experience downtime. This can impact user experience.

Limited Scalability: If there is a sudden surge in incoming traffic, a single server may struggle to handle the load. Scaling options, such as adding more servers or using cloud services, should be considered for improved scalability.
